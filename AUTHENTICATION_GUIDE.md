# SeaTrue Authentication System - Setup & Usage Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Been Implemented

Your complete authentication system is now ready with the following features:

### üîê Backend (API)
- **AuthController** with comprehensive endpoints:
  - `POST /api/Auth/signup` - User registration with role-specific profiles
  - `POST /api/Auth/login` - User authentication
  - `POST /api/Auth/logout` - Session termination
  - `GET /api/Auth/me` - Get current user profile
- **Session Management** - 24-hour sessions with cookies
- **Password Hashing** - SHA256 hashing (ready for bcrypt/Argon2 upgrade)
- **Database Schema Updates** - Added DateOfBirth and PreferredDeliveryAddress to BuyerProfile

### üé® Frontend (Client)
- **auth.js** - Centralized authentication manager
- **Login Modals** - On all pages (homepage, marketplace, fisher, learn)
- **Signup Forms** - Comprehensive forms with role-specific fields:
  - Fisher: National ID, address, experience, fishing method, home port, license details
  - Buyer: Date of birth, delivery address, organization details (optional)
- **Dynamic Navbar** - Changes based on login status (Login/Signup vs Profile/Logout)
- **Profile Page** - View complete user and role-specific information
- **Protected Routes** - Authentication checks on:
  - Fisher page - Must be logged in as Fisher to verify catches
  - Marketplace - Must be logged in as Buyer to purchase fish

### üîí Security Features
- Session persistence across page refreshes (using localStorage + session cookies)
- Role-based access control
- Automatic redirects after login based on user role
- Protected actions with authentication checks

## üöÄ How to Test

### Step 1: Start the Backend API

```bash
cd api
dotnet run
```

The API should start on `http://localhost:5142` (or your configured port).

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** If your API runs on a different port, update the `API_BASE_URL` in `/client/resources/scripts/auth.js`:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/api';
```

### Step 2: Start the Frontend

Open the client folder in your browser using Live Server or similar:
- Right-click on `client/resources/homepage.html`
- Select "Open with Live Server"

Or manually open: `http://127.0.0.1:5500/client/resources/homepage.html`
